# Object-Detection-in-Images
Computer science mini project submitted in satisfaction of my third year at Department of Technology, Shivaji University, Kolhapur.

The program takes in an image file as input and detect most objects from it by drawing a border around the respective object. It also displays a table listing all the objects that it has managed to detect and the percentage probability of their accuracy.
